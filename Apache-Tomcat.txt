# Create Tomcat User and Group

# Create group for tomcat
sudo groupadd tomcat

# create user for tomcat
sudo useradd -s /bin/false -g tomcat -d /opt/tomcat tomcat

# change directory to tmp
cd /tmp

# Download the latest binary Tomcat release navigate to the https://tomcat.apache.org/
curl -O https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-10/v10.1.25/bin/apache-tomcat-10.1.25.tar.gz

# create a new /opt/tomcat/ directory with the command:
sudo mkdir /opt/tomcat

# To extract the tar.gz Tomcat file
sudo tar xzvf apache-tomcat-10*tar.gz -C /opt/tomcat --strip-components=1

# Move to the directory where the Tomcat installation is located:
cd /opt/tomcat

# Grant group and user ownership over the installation directory to the tomcat group and user with the command
sudo chown -RH tomcat: /opt/tomcat

# Lastly, change script permissions to grant execute access in /opt/tomcat/bin/with:
sudo sh -c 'chmod +x /opt/tomcat/bin/*.sh'

# Since you are going to to use Tomcat as a service, you need to create a systemd service file
# To configure the file, you first need to find the JAVA_HOME path. This is the exact location of the Java installation package.
# To do so, prompt the system to give you information about the Java packages installed on the system. In the terminal, type:
sudo update-java-alternatives -l

# Choose the version you want to use and copy its location. With that, you can move on to create the service file.
# Create and open a new file in the /etc/system/system under the name tomcat.service:
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/tomcat.service

# Once the file opens, copy and paste the content below, changing the JAVA_HOME value to the information you found in the previous step.

# Save and Exit the file (Ctrl+X, followed by y[es] and Enter).

# For the changes to take place, reload the system daemon with the command:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Now, you can finally start the Tomcat service:
sudo systemctl start tomcat

# Verify the Apache Tomcat service is running with the command:
sudo systemctl status tomcat

# Open Port 8080 to allow traffic through it with the command:
sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp

# Configure Web Management Interface
# you need to create a user who can use the web management interface.
# To do this, open and edit the users file,  Open the users file with the command:
sudo nano /opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml

# Delete everything from the file and add the following:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<tomcat-users>
  <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
  <role rolename="manager-script"/>
  <role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
  <role rolename="manager-status"/>
  <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
  <role rolename="admin-script"/>
  <user username="admin" password="Your_Password" roles="manager-gui, manager-script, manager-jmx, manager-status, admin-gui, admin-script"/>
</tomcat-users>

# Save and Exit the file.

# Configure Remote Access
# This is required. By default, Tomcat is only accessible from the local machine.
# First, open the manager file:
sudo nano /opt/tomcat/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml

# Next, decide whether to grant access from a. anywhere or b. from a specific IP address.
# To make it publicly accessible, add the following lines to the file:
<Context antiResourceLocking="false" privileged="true">
<!--
<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
allow="127\.\d+\.\d+.d+|::1|0000:1" />
-->
</Context>

# To allow access from a specific IP address, add the IP to the previous command, as follows:
<Context antiResourceLocking="false" privileged="true">
<!--
<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0000:1|THE.IP.ADDRESS." />
-->
</Context>

# Repeat the same process for the host-manager file.
# Start by opening the file with the command:
sudo nano /opt/tomcat/latest/webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml
